            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Hello! I’m Marcus, a musical theatre actor, dancer, and gymnastics coach from Phoenix, Arizona, with a zest for creativity and a love for teaching. Whether I'm on stage, in the gym, or at a piano, I bring energy, passion, and a sprinkle of humor to everything I do.</p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">From a young age, music has been my gateway to the world of artistic expression. I’ve been playing the piano for over 15 years. Trained in Jazz, Tap, Ballet, Modern, and many other styles, I’ve explored every corner of the dance floor. After years of competitive dance, I transitioned into coaching gymnastics and parkour for all ages and skill levels under USA Gymnastics and NinjaZone. My coaching philosophy emphasizes spatial awareness and strength building. I firmly believe that with the right control and awareness, gymnastics becomes not only accessible and fun for everyone but also a whole lot safer.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">When I’m not coaching or dancing, you can find me composing short, silly songs on the piano or diving into new subjects to expand my knowledge (Most recently coding! I made this website and some other things you can check out on my projects page).  I’m a graduate of the American Musical and Dramatic Academy and currently juggle auditions for various roles while studying elementary and secondary education.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">I love working with kids, whether it’s teaching gymnastics, parkour, and dance classes or one-on-one private instruction in piano. I’ve also had the joy of nannying and babysitting for families, working with children aged 3 to 17.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Creating and collaborating on artistic projects fuels my soul, and I’m always on the lookout for new opportunities to bring a little more creativity and joy into the world. Whether you’re looking for a dynamic performer, a dedicated coach, or a fun-loving educator, I’m your guy!</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Feel free to reach out – let's make something amazing together!</p>
